# Unity config file - v1.0 
# - defines 'unity' compilation units for a project/solution.
#
# Top Tips
#  Regex
#   - Regexs can be of a form that include folders and exclude specific files / file patterns.
#      - eg. ^(((\.*|\w:)\/)*)(ai|animation)\/(((?!exclusions_can\.|go_here\.).)*)(\.)(cpp|c)$
#      - Interactive regexp help? :- http://www.rubular.com/
#  Commands
#   - In addition to regexs global exclusions are supported making it easy to see what is being excluded.
#   - Ideally nothing should need to be excluded, too many exclusions will lead to a slow build.
#   - Leave a comment why something is excluded.
#   - Comment out 'set enabled' to disable the unity build.
#  Design
#   - Coupling related systems within each compilation unit can lead to better build speed.
#   - Evenly balancing the number of matched files across each compilation is also good practice.
