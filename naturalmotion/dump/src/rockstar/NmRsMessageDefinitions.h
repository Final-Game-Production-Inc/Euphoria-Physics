activePose:  This will take any animation currently set as the incoming transforms of the agent and drive the character to the pose defined therein. To constantly drive an agent to an animation, this message must be sent every frame. The stiffness of the characters joints will determine how closely they match the animation pose.
The mask value determines which effector sets will be modified. Specifying 'fb' or no mask value will cause the effect to be applied to the whole character.
Otherwise, specify 'l' or 'u' for the first character to mask off to just lower or upper body parts. Then, you can specify the following for the second character:
When the first character is 'u', the second parameter can be:
* 'c' = just clavicles
* 'l' = left arm only
* 'r' = right arm only
* 'a' = both arms and clavicles
* 's' = just spine
* 't' = torso only, eg. spine & arms and Clavicles
* 'k' = trunk only, eg. spine & head
* 'n' = neck and head
* 'b' = everything
* 'w' = wrists
when the first character is 'l', the second parameter can be:
* 'l' = just left leg
* 'r' = just right leg
* 'b' = both legs
* 'a' = both ankles
note that the characters should be lower-case.
==================================================
To allow allow any combinations of joints to be masked:
1) Mask can be a string of BITWISE logic operators (no brackets or spaces allowed) on the above 2 character masks eg. 'uc&ul' - left clavicle, 'ub&~uw' - ub except for wrists, 'ul|ur' left and right arms.
2) Mask can now also take a bitMask value (limited to 32 bits) expressed as a string. 
Masking is performed on a part basis.  To mask a particular joint, indicate the joint's child part.
* Mask can be a bitMask in hex '0x********'.
* Mask can be a bitMask in binary '0b**...**'.

mask includes (all) neck and head/ua,ul,ur/ua,ul,ur respectively.
The mask value determines which effector sets will be modified. Specifying 'fb' or no mask value will cause the effect to be applied to the whole character.
Otherwise, specify 'l' or 'u' for the first character to mask off to just lower or upper body parts. Then, you can specify the following for the second character:
When the first character is 'u', the second parameter can be:
* 'c' = just clavicles
* 'l' = left arm only
* 'r' = right arm only
* 'a' = both arms and clavicles
* 's' = just spine
* 't' = torso only, eg. spine & arms and Clavicles
* 'k' = trunk only, eg. spine & head
* 'n' = neck and head
* 'b' = everything
* 'w' = wrists
when the first character is 'l', the second parameter can be:
* 'l' = just left leg
* 'r' = just right leg

/*
armsWindmill:  Arms pedaling motion with target ellipses of arbitrary orientation.
Things to know: the orientation of an ellipse is defined by rotations around the axes of its local TM, which is initially taken
to be the TM of the part whose ID is given. The x-Axis is the ellipse's normal, and y-Axis/z-Axis are the major and minor axes 
respectively. By default (or when all components of the rotation are 0) the normal of the ellipse points straight out the
side of a character. From that starting pose, first a y-rotation is applied, rotating the circle around its vertical axis, 
followed by a z-rotation, controlling how parallel to the floor the ellipse is. Finally an x-rotation twists the ellipse
around its normal. 
To simplify things a mirror-mode can be enabled such that only one orientation has to be specified. In that case,
the right ellipse will either be symmetrically mirrored from the left around the body's vertical plane (mode=1), 
or will be exactly parallel to the left (mode=2).
Also, an adaptive mode can be enabled, in which case the arms rotate depending on the character's rotation around the
somersault axis. In mode=1, only the direction of rotation changes. Mode=2 makes the speed proportional to the characters
current angular rotation and mode=3 adds modulation of arm strengths, allowing for loose limbs when character has low angular
rotation.
BodyParts:  Left and/or right arms (including clavicles)

/*
fallOverWall:  A stunt-man style behaviour used to encourage the character to flip himself over waist-high-or-lower wall obstacles. This uses a pair of cheat forces, 
one to get the character lifted over the wall, another to provide twist to the spine as he does so to make the flip look less artificial. 
The behaviour waits for collision with the spine or lower arms/hands to determine which point to flip over, or a custom point can be specified in the message instead.
Works in conjunction with a BodyBalance and a leanInDirection/leanToPosition/leanTowardsObject.

grab:  NOTE: An upper body behaviour.
An upper body behaviour that Grabs or Braces against a point, the nearest point on a line or the nearest point on a surface.  Turns head, twists body and pelvis. Set useleft and useright to use the desired hands. Grab will create a constrant between the hand and a object. Brace will not create any constraint. 
This behaviour can be played over other behaviours. However it includes logic about if and when to grab, so will not grab things behind the character or things that are out of reach.  
There are 3 ways to specify the grab points.
Points: right grab/brace point (pos1) and/or left grab/brace point(pos2).
Line: grabs/braces with the left and/or right hand to the nearest point on the line between (pos1) and (pos2). 
Quad Surface: grabs/braces to the surface specified by (pos1), (pos2), (pos3) and (pos4). These points must be specified in a anitclockwise order.
The normals ( right/left are normal(normalR)/normal(normalL) respectively) can be specified for all of the grab point input methods. If no normal is specified the behaviour will attempt to find the appropriate normal.
The grab points are specified in the coord frame of the instance specified by instanceIndex. ( -1 = world space).
PullUp: setting a pull up strength , pullUpStrength, result in the arms trying to pull relative to this strength over a time pullUpTime. 0 = no attempt to pull up. 1 = attemp to pull up the maximum amount.

yanked:  This provides a yanked behaviour.  Used in RDR for a lasso reaction - lasso was either on upperTorso nr spine2/3 or around both feet. 
To provide a whiplash effect from the force applied the stiffness/damping of the upper body can be at a start value for a specified time then it is ramped up from this value to the final value over a specified time.
Blindly tries to grab at where a rope around upper torso would be.
Tries to twist and turn /Leans hips against direction of yank - as though struggling.
Modifies friction on feet to give a sliding effect. 
On floor:  CatchFall with hula/escapologist reaction.  Augmented with a roll over behaviour.
